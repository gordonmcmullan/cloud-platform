# Scheduled PR Reminders

Scheduled reminders help the Cloud Platform focus on the most important review requests that require their attention. Scheduled reminders for pull requests will send a message to various Slack channels with all open pull requests that the team have been asked to review (or need merging), at a specified time. For example, you can create a scheduled reminder to send a message to your team's main communication channel in Slack, including all open pull requests that the team is requested to review, everyday at 9:00 a.m.

All reminders are created on Github Team level - For the Cloud Platform team, the team is `webops`

To view all scheduled reminders for team webops:

https://github.com/ministryofjustice > Teams > Webops > Settings > Scheduled Reminders

There is currently only 1 reminder setup;

- **cloud-platform**

    Reports all open PRs for the cloud-platform-environments repos at 9am UTC Monday to Friday.

### Steps required for new repositories

New repositories are not automatically added to reminders and require the following steps;

1. Add the new repository to the Github Slack app -
https://github.com/ministryofjustice > Settings > Installed Github Apps > Slack

2. Go into the reminder that the new repository is required to be reported on and add it in the 'select repositories' section.
